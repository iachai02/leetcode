# 15. 3Sum

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`. Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

## Solution

```python
def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    res = []

    # sort the array
    nums.sort()

    # iterate through each number in the list
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # this checks for duplicates (i.e. if the number before was the same as the next number)
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            continue

        # gets the left and right pointer that is after the initial number
        l, r = i + 1, len(nums) - 1

        # two pointer method
        while l < r:
            # gets the sum of the three numbers
            threeSum = nums[i] + nums[l] + num[r]

            # if the sum is greater than 0, that means we need to decrease the sum which means moving the right pointer to the left
            if threeSum > 0:
                r -= 1

            # if the sum is less than 0, that means we need to increase the sum which means moving the left pointer to the right
            elif threeSum < 0:
                l += 1

            # this means that we found the sum equal to 0
            else:
                # add the three numbers to the array
                res.append([nums[i], nums[l], nums[r]])

                # move the left pointer until there are no duplicates
                l += 1
                while nums[l] == nums[l-1] and l < r:
                    l += 1
    return res
```

## Example

1. Input: `nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]`
2. res = [], sorted nums = [-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]
3. start at nums[0] = -4
4. l = i + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 and r = 5
5. threeSum = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r] = -4 + -1 + 2 = -3
6. -3 < 0, so l += 1 = 2
7. samething, l = 3
8. threeSum = -4 + 0 + 2 = -2 < 0, so l += 1 = 4
9. threeSum = -4 + 1 + 2 = -1 < 0, so l += 1 = 5 = r = 5
10. nums[1] = -1
11. l = i + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 and r = 5
12. threeSum = -1 + -1 + 2 = 0
13. res = [[-1, -1, 2]], l += 1 = 3, nums[l] = 0 != nums[l-1] = -1
14. threeSum = -1 + 0 + 2 = 1 > 0, r -= 1 = 4
15. threeSum = -1 + 0 + 1 = 0
16. res = [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]], l += 1 = 4 and l = r = 4
17. return [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
